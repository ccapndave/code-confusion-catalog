# Literature Reviews

The goal of this repo is to house markdown documents exploring proposed language and library additions to the Elm language.

## What's a Steward?

A literature review requires a single point of contact, called a steward.
This person is usually the principal author of the review, but it doesn't have to be.
They should be willing to answer any issues or questions about their review, and coordinate work on it.

If a literature review is a team effort, this should still be a single person.
The steward serves as the point person for discussions, and routes questions to the most appropriate venue or person.
You can list the rest of the team elsewhere in the document for credit's sake, or keep a human-meaningful changelog.

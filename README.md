# Literature Reviews

The goal of this repo is to house markdown documents exploring proposed language and library additions to the Elm language.


## Gathering feedback before submitting

It's often helpful to get feedback on your concept before getting into the detail required for a literature review.
You may open an issue on this repo to start a high-level discussion, with the goal of eventually creating a literature review pull request. In addition you can post a message to the [elm-discuss mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/elm-discuss) or chat to the folks over at [Slack](https://elmlang.herokuapp.com/).

## The process

* Fork the [the elm-community/literature-reviews repo](https://github.com/elm-community/literature-reviews)
* Copy `TEMPLATE.md` to `my-feature-name/README.md`
* Fill in the template
* Submit a pull request. As a pull request the literature review will receive feedback from the larger community, and the author should be prepared to revise it in response.
* Eventually, the community will decide whether the literature review should be merged.

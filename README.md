# Literature Reviews

This repo houses markdown documents exploring proposed language and library additions to the Elm language. This includes:

- Extensions to the Elm language, syntax, and semantics.
- Modifications or extensions of the core Elm packages. These are for the Elm "standard library", including packages like `List`, `Dict`, and `Json.Decode`.
- Large community-focused informational documents (why do we do it *that* way?)

## Stewards

A literature review requires a single point of contact, called a steward.
This person is usually the principal author of the review, but it doesn't have to be.
They should be willing to answer any issues or questions about their review, and coordinate work on it.

If a literature review is a team effort, this should still be a single person.
The steward serves as the point person for discussions, and routes questions to the most appropriate venue or person.
You can list the rest of the team elsewhere in the document for credit's sake, or keep a human-meaningful changelog.

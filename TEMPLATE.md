# <Name of Feature>

Define your feature. What will you be able to do if it's implemented? Define the main pieces of terminology. If applicable, define what it is *not*.

## Motivation
Why is this feature useful? Why do you want it in Elm?

## Current best practice
Describe the best way(s) of doing what you want to do in Elm today. This can include prose, code snippets, or a link to a working example within this repo. Discuss what makes this situation less than ideal.

## Use cases from real projects
Elm features are only added once it's been proven that they solve a problem the occurs in real projects. The more example use cases that are made available the better the final design will be. It's important that these aren't hypothetical scenarios or toy problems, they need to be from real projects that developers are working on.

## Literature review
How do other langues implement this feature or address this problem? Be sure to look at other ML-family langues (e.g. Haskell, OCaml, F#) and the JavaScript ecosystem.

What approachs work well? Which ones do not? Have other communities written design documents or retrospectives on this feature?

## Proposed API or syntaz
Briefly and provisionally describe a library API or language syntax for the feature. Connect the API with the design goals established above.
